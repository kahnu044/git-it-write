# Git it Write

_Git it Write_ is a WordPress plugin which allows to publish the markdown files present in a GitHub repository to 
your WordPress site. So with this plugin, whenever the files are added, updated in the repository the WordPress post will be added, updated accordingly.

This plugin is inspired from static site generators like `Jekyll`, `Next.js`, `Gatsby.js` on how content is written is markdown. This is a similar idea for WordPress where markdown data is parsed from GitHub and published as posts.

üëì **Live example:** [Source GitHub repository](https://github.com/vaakash/aakash-web) (`/docs/` folder) to [Posts published](https://www.aakashweb.com/docs/)

üì¶ **Download/Install:** [Git it write](https://wordpress.org/plugins/git-it-write/) on WordPress plugin repository

‚ö° **Getting started:** [Get started](https://www.aakashweb.com/docs/git-it-write/getting-started/) with _Git it Write_. Learn how to write `.md` files and publish posts on WordPress.

This allows people to collaborate with the post, share edits and suggestions in GitHub which when pulled the WordPress post will be updated automatically.

### üñ•Ô∏è Example

If a repository has files in the below structure, then below posts will be created (if permalinks are configured and 
the post type supports "hierarchy" i.e. creating posts level by level, like `/pages` in the example below).

**File structure in the GitHub repository:**

    docs/
        guide/
            introduction.md
            getting-started.md
    help/
        faq.md

This will be the result when post type has hierarchy support. They will be posted level by level for every folder in the repository. The folder's post will be taken from the `index.md` file if exists under that folder.
